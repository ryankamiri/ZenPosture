# 🧘 **Zen Posture**  

## 📌 **Inspiration**  
In today's age, many people spend countless hours in front of computers, especially in computer science, leading to poor posture and potential health issues. We recognized the need for a solution that actively helps users maintain good posture while working, studying, or browsing online. This inspired us to create **Zen Posture**, a desktop application that serves as your personal posture companion.  

## 💡 **What It Does**  
**Zen Posture** is an intelligent desktop application that uses real-time posture detection to help users maintain healthy sitting positions throughout their day. The application features include:  
- ✅ **Real-time posture monitoring** – Utilizes webcam input and TensorFlow to detect poor posture.  
- ✅ **Scheduled exercises** – Guides users through exercises with reminders to prevent muscle strain.  
- ✅ **Detailed analytics** – Tracks posture and improvement over time.  

## 🛠 **How We Built It**  
We developed **Zen Posture** using a modern tech stack:  
- 🖥 **Electron.js** for seamless desktop integration.  
- 🎨 **React** for the front-end UI.  
- 🛢 **MongoDB Atlas** to facilitate smooth interaction between the front end and back end.  
- 🤖 **TensorFlow** AI stack that trains data based on points plotted at the user's shoulders and nose.  
- 🔔 **Lightweight notification system** to alert users when poor posture is detected, promoting better ergonomics.  

## 🚧 **Challenges We Ran Into**  
We faced multiple challenges, including:  
- ❌ **Integrating the backend, frontend, and machine learning components.**  
- 🎭 **Designing a sleek, user-friendly interface.**  
- 🔍 **Overcoming backend issues**—initially, we didn’t use MongoDB Atlas, but we worked around it using the community version.  
- 🔗 **Solving compatibility issues** by carefully reading integration documentation and ensuring all components worked together.  

## 🏆 **Accomplishments That We're Proud Of**  
- 🎨 **Created a sleek, modern interface** that makes posture tracking engaging.  
- 📢 **Implemented an efficient notification system** to help users stay mindful.  
- 📊 **Developed a comprehensive analytics dashboard** for progress tracking.  
- 💻 **Built a cross-platform desktop application** that runs smoothly.  
- 🤖 **Created a machine learning model** that accurately detects poor posture.  
- 📏 **Utilized geometry** to calculate the distance between the shoulders and nose—if the user is hunched over, the distance shortens.  
- 🏋️ **Trained the model on hundreds of images**, normalized the data, and created a posture score (1-100) based on user alignment.  

## 📚 **What We Learned**  
- 💻 **Developing a desktop application** using Electron.js.  
- 📈 **Implementing real-time data processing** and visualization for posture tracking.  
- 🎯 **Using BlazePose** to map body points.  
- 📐 **Applying geometry** to detect breaks in posture.  
- 🚀 **Optimizing performance** for continuous monitoring.  
- 🎨 **Designing a health-focused UI** for user engagement.  
- 🤝 **The importance of teamwork and communication**—we worked collaboratively, sharing ideas and supporting each other.  

## 🚀 **What's Next for Zen Posture**  
There’s so much potential for **Zen Posture**, and we aim to expand its capabilities:  
- 🔬 **Improved machine learning** for more accurate posture detection.  
- ⚕️ **Additional health-based detection systems.**  
- ☁️ **Cloud synchronization** to track progress across multiple devices.  
- 🎮 **Social features**—users can form groups, compete, and earn rewards based on posture improvement.
